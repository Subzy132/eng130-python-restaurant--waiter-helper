# restaurant waiter helper
 I was given a task to create a program allows a user to see a menu and make an order
User Stories


1 AS a User I want to be able to see the menu in a formated way, so that I can order my meal.

- I created a list called menu and added all the components of the menu
- Used a for loop to go through every index
- Printed every item on the menu to make it easy for the user to read.

2 AS a User I want to be able to order 3 times, and have my responses added to a list so they aren't forgotten

- created an empty list so that i have somewhere to put the orders
- took in the user's FIRST order and assigned it to a variable
- appended the order to the empty list
- took in the user's SECOND order and assigned it to a variable
- appended the order to the end of the list
- took in the user's THIRD order and assigned it to a variable
- appended the order to the end of the list


3 As a user, I want to have my order read back to me in formated way so I know what I ordered.

- Now that I had the order's stored i just needed to print it out
- Using a for loop I went through the list and printed every index out in a formatted way
